# Project I: Flight Simulator
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2020
***

# Purpose

This project assesses your mastery of implementation and viewing transformations. It brings together many of the topics we cover in Module II. These are:

- viewing
- shading
- interaction
- geometry

# Background

For this assignment, you should
- be able to visualize 3D Cartesian space
- understand camera parameters and their representation in WebGL
- be able to capture user interaction and have it effect your WebGL program
- know the various shading schemes
- be able to judge the best platform (CPU/application program vs. GPU/shader) to execute a desired functionality
- be able to apply trigonometric operations
- understand the memory interaction between the CPU and the GPU
- know WebGL's coordinate system and drawing routines
- be able to write one or more files in order to display GPU-supported renderings in an HMTL page
- be able to look up, where necessary, and implement the functions and syntax in HTML, JavaScript, and WebGL for desired functionality.

# The Problem Set

The problems are defined in `proj1.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Time Requirement.

Based on feedback from the last set of students that attempted this assignment, the number of hours that your team will require to complete this homework are as follows.

- (min, max) : (14, 65)
- (mean, median, st.dev.) : (42.25, 37.5, 17.88)

# Grading

Grading will be as per the criteria specified in the accompanying review file, _hw3-review.xlsx_.

# Submission

There are 2 parts to the submission. There is no peer review as the submission will be graded by the instructor.

## 1. Problem Set

Please follow the naming instructions exactly. The correctly named files in your GitHub repository at the time of the deadline will be considered your submission. As your submission will be graded by the instructor _as is_, make sure to include online links to any non-submitted files that are used by your code, e.g. those from the `Common` folder.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Friday, 13 November.

## 2. Feedback Form

You will provide feedback on your teammates and on the project. The related form will be available on LMS with further instructions.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Friday, 13 November.

# Fun Stuff

Students tend to get carried away and implement many additional features. There is nothing wrong with that! While these will not earn extra marks, please state them clearly on the main page so that I may become aware of your additional efffort.

## Tips

- This project involves a lot of work so start early.
- There is no late submission. Submit whatever you have by the deadline.
- Failure to turn in any of the above submissions will result in a deduction of marks for the homework.
- viel Spa√ü!


# Discussion

There is a lot to handle and there are bound to be confusions and queries. Please share them using the following avenues.


- discuss with your teammate,
- the discussion forum on LMS,
- discuss with your peers,
- talk to course staff.
